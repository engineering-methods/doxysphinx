        .. tip::
           
           This snippet here is needed to trigger the pre-to-div-postprocessor.
           Only when there is "mixed"-content it will be triggered.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        This is preformatted content
        without any rst in it.
        The parser should change this to a div tag
        with class "fragment" and subdivs 
        with class "line" for each line.
